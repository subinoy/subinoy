## Hi Everyone!! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Subinoy, a highly motivated Bioinformatician Data Scientist with a background in NGS and Machine Learning! I have expertise in analyzing complex genomic data, specializing in **Cancer** and **Alzheimer's disease** research. Skilled in **variant** and **CNV** analysis from **WGS** and **WES** data, building robust **bioinformatics pipelines** for various genomic data types, including bulk **RNA-Seq**, **ATAC-Seq**, **single-cell RNA-Seq**, and **network** data analysis. I also have experience in system administration of **CentOS HPC clusters** and a passionate Linux user including **Raspberry Pi** and other microcontrollers. I love developing innovative **machine learning** algorithms not only for my research, but in various other data science projects incuding finance!
